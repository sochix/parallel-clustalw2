HOWTO COMPILE THE SOURCE AND INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need a Unix environment with a working C++ compiler to
compile the parallel_ClustalW source. We recommened GCC>=4.2. 
Also you need an installed tc-malloc library, path can be specified at src/Makefile.am
Then run autoreconf.

ICC users need to configure the package as follows:
./configure CXX=icpc

Open MPI users need to configure the package as follows:
./configure CXX=mpicxx


For compilation under Windows you will probably need to install
mingw and cygwin.

Type
$ ./configure
$ make
This will create a clustalw binary in the src directory.

To install the software type
$ make install
(might have to be executed as superuser)
or simply copy the clustalw binary to a directory of your choice.
